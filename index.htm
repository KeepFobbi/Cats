                <h1>What Is A Cat?</h1>
                <span>
                    The domestic cat is a complex creature and unfortunately, problems can arise for cats because sometimes we do not understand their natural drives and reactions. Understanding what kind of environment they prefer to occupy, their social structure, feeding patterns and even toilet habits can influence decisions made about their care that have a significant benefit to their quality of life.

                    <h1>Hunter</h1>
                    <span>
                        The cat has evolved physically and behaviourally to be a specialist hunter and top of the food chain predator; motivated and driven by the sight and sound of prey. In order to be a successful hunter, the cat’s natural rhythms will fit the time when its main prey of small creatures are active and vulnerable – usually at dawn and dusk.

                    <h1>Carnivore</h1>
                        <span>The cat has been such a successful hunter that it never needed to revert to vegetable matter to bolster its diet, thereby evolving as an obligate carnivore, unable to survive or thrive without nutritional components found in meat.</span>

                <h1 class="Title_Hunter">What does this mean for you, the owner?</h1>
                    <span class="Title_Hunter">Cats fit into a wide range of lifestyles with us – indeed they often appear to cope very well. Sometimes, however, they can be pushed too far, fail to cope any longer and problems may occur. When cats are stressed long term they may exhibit a range of behaviours, such as urine spraying or soiling indoors, fearfulness or occasionally even aggression, which are all part of their natural repertoire but do not fit in with our expectations of them as pets in our homes.</span>
